#  Dataset

This repository contains tools for generating a dataset from gameplay screenshots of the game *Sky Fighter*. The goal is to process and annotate gameplay screenshots for machine learning tasks, particularly object detection. This dataset includes annotated images in YOLO format, identifying key objects like player ships, enemies, bullets, power-ups, and obstacles.

## Project Structure

- **src/main.rs** - The main Rust source file that drives the dataset processing and annotation logic.
- **screenshots/** - Directory containing raw gameplay screenshots.
- **annotations/** - Directory for storing YOLO-format annotations generated by the application.
- **config/** - Configuration files to control annotation parameters and object categories.

## Features

- **Object Detection and Annotation**: Detects and annotates all specified objects in screenshots.
- **YOLO Format Output**: Generates annotations compatible with YOLO format for machine learning tasks.
- **Efficient Processing**: Processes thousands of images rapidly, optimized for large datasets.

## Object Categories

The objects annotated in each gameplay screenshot are categorized as follows:

1. **Playerâ€™s Ship**
2. **Enemies**
3. **Bullets/Missiles**
4. **Power-ups**
5. **Obstacles**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rust**: Ensure you have the Rust toolchain installed. Visit [Rust's official site](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to install it.
- **OpenCV** (optional): If you want to enable image processing optimizations, ensure OpenCV is installed and properly configured.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/vladimirovertheworld/skyforcedataset.git
   cd skyforcedataset
   ```
   
Build the project:
```
cargo build --release
```
Usage
Place your gameplay screenshots in the ./screenshots directory, then run the following command to start the annotation process:
```
cargo run --release
```
Annotated images in YOLO format will be saved in the ./annotations directory.

### Configuration

Modify the configuration files in the config directory to adjust the parameters for object detection and to customize which object categories are processed. This allows for flexibility in annotation criteria.
